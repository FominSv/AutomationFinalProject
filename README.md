# About
The project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure. 
It is built in hierarchy order of modules. There are main/common/helpers/actions/page_object modules. 
In this way, the tests can be created in very simple way with a minimum lines of code. Also the infrastructure allows to work with differend kinds of applications.
Big advantage of the infrastructure is that it can be easy maintained!

## Project Overview
The project is an example of infrastructure for automation testing of different kinds of applications:
- Web based application
- Mobile application
- Web API
- Electron application
- Desktop application
## Infrastructure project includes using of:

Infrastructure project includes using of:

- Page Object Design Pattern
- Project Layers(Extensions/Work Flows/Test Cases...)
- Support of Different Clients/Browsers
- Failure Mechanism
- Common Functionality
- External Files Support
- Reporting System (including screenshots)
- Visual Testing
- DB support
- CI support

## Tools & Frameworks used in the project:

- TestNG - Testing Framework
- Listeners - interface used to generate logs and customize the TestNG reports
- MySQL Free Online DB - used for login to Grafana web page
- Jenkins- for tests execution
- REST Assured - for API testing
- Allure Reports - as the main reporting system

## Tests Execution:
Each of the applications has a few tests for demonstration purpose.
These tests can be developed in a very simple way, due to a lot of work with the infrastructure. [Sanity Tests]
